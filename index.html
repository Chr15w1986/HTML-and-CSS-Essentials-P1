            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p>My name is Chris Williams and I am thirty five years old.
                 I live in Polesworth with my fianc√©e, two children and our dog.
                 Having worked in the vehicle repair industry for the last fifteen years, 
                 I'm now embarking on a new venture in Software Development. 
                 My spare time is spent being outdoors, cycling, camping and walking our dog.</p>

            <h3>Education:</h3>
            <p>After leaving Lighthall School in 2001, 
                I went on to achieve a First Diploma in Vehicle Repair and 
                Technology at Tachbrook Park Technology College. 
                Continuing for a further two years of studying Motorsport Engineering, 
                once graduated, I moved on to a Foundation Degree in Motorsport Engineering and Fluid Dynamics. </p>

            <h3>Goals:</h3>
            <p>With the motor industry now veering towards all electric cars, 
                electrical and electronic diagnostics has taken over the mechanical 
                engineering part of the job.This has piqued my interest further 
                into the world of computers and in general, software development.
                My main goal is to be proficient in all areas of this course in the 
                hope that this will lead to a career in Software Development. </p>
